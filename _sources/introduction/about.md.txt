## Breadcrumbs

Often in this document, the steps are described in 'breadcrumbs' form such as this:

{{ macros.breadcrumb_square('"Do A first" -> "Then do B" -> "Finally do C"') }}
<br/>

Usually these reference GUI location where to click to navigate the menus, submenus, their tabs and dialogs.
There are few common places where these breadcrumbs start:



 - The `SoftConsole Menu toolbar` as starting location, example:

   {{ macros.breadcrumb_indent('"SoftConsole Menu toolbar" -> "Run" -> "Debug Configurations"', '   ') }}

   Which is located under the Window's title: 

   ![board image](images/breadcrumbs/menu_toolbar.png)



 - The `Project's properties` as starting location, example:

   {{ macros.breadcrumb_indent('"Project Properties" -> "C/C++ Build" -> "Settings" -> "Tool Settings" -> "GNU RISC-V Cross C/C++ Linker" -> "General" -> "Check \'-nostartfiles\'"', '   ') }}

   Which requires the user to first go into Project's settings/properties by following these steps:

   {{ macros.breadcrumb_indent('"Right click on <your_project> in the Project Explorer" -> "Properties"', '   ') }}

   ![board image](images/breadcrumbs/project_properties.png)

   It opens the following menu and can be navigated with the breadcrumbs:

   {{ macros.breadcrumb_indent('"Project Properties" -> "C/C++ Build" -> "Settings" -> "Tool Settings" -> "GNU RISC-V Cross C/C++ Linker" -> "General" -> "Check \'-nostartfiles\'"', '   ') }}

   ![board image](images/breadcrumbs/project_properties_menu.png)



 - The launchers `Debug configuration` as starting location, example:

   {{ macros.breadcrumb_indent('"Debug Configuration" -> "Debugger" -> "GDB Client Setup" -> "Commands"', '   ') }}

   Which requires the user to open the corresponding debug launcher associated with your project:

   {{ macros.breadcrumb_indent('"SoftConsole Menu toolbar" -> "Run" -> "Debug Configurations" -> "Launcher for \<YOUR_PROJECT\>"', '   ') }}

   ```{note}
   Each project might have multiple Debug Launchers associated with the project, for example one `hw` for Hardware targets and one `Renode` for Renode emulated targets. User needs to select the coresponding launcher within the context of the SoftConsole chapter. Renode troubleshooting guide will expect users to select the Renode variants of the launchers.
   ```

   This will open the following dialog menu:
