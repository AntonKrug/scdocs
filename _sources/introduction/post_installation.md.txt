Renode depedencies on Windows
-----------------------------

The Renode emulation platform is not a crucial sub-module of SoftConsole and users who are intending to connect to hardware targets only do not need satisfy the Renode's dependencies.


``````{tabs}

````{tab} Windows 10/8.1

The Renode emulation platform can be used out of the box on many Windows 10/8.1 machines. 
However in a rare case when the .NET Framework is not already installed with Windows 10/8.1 then it can be changed easily from within Windows features menu.

{{ macros.breadcrumb_square('"Start button" -> "Type \'Turn Windows features on or off\'" -> "Select \'.NET Framework 4.8\'" -> "Click OK"') }}

```{note}
A administrative account is required to access the Windows features menu.
```

Linux post installation steps
-----------------------------

1. Many platforms have GCC and make packages installed by default, but it is advisable to make sure that these are installed.


    ``````{tabs}
    
    ````{tab} Ubuntu/Debian
    
    ```{code-block} bash
    apt-get install build-essential
    ```
    ````
    
    
    ````{tab} CentOS/RHEL
    
    ```{code-block} bash
    yum groupinstall 'Development Tools'
    ```
    ````
    
    ````{tab} OpenSuse/LEAP
    
    ```{code-block} bash
    zypper install -t pattern devel_basis
    ```
    ````
    
    ``````

2. It is recommended that the Linux platform used to run SoftConsole has all available updates installed.

    ```{note}
    It may be possible to install and run SoftConsole on other Linux distributions or versions once the required packages are installed. However, some earlier distributions (for example, CentOS/RHEL 5.x and 6.x) may not work and are not recommended or supported.
    ```

```{note}
For users who wish to use Renode on a unsupported platform, they can on their own risk visit [mono project website](https://www.mono-project.com/download/stable/) and follow the instructions.
```

Users, wishing to write Renode models can use [Mono Develop IDE](https://www.monodevelop.com/).
