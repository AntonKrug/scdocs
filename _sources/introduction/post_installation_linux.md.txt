    ``````{tabs}
    
    ````{tab} Ubuntu/Debian
    
    ```{code-block} bash
    apt-get install build-essential
    ```
    ````
    
    
    ````{tab} CentOS/RHEL
    
    ```{code-block} bash
    yum groupinstall 'Development Tools'
    ```
    ````
    
    ````{tab} OpenSuse/LEAP
    
    ```{code-block} bash
    zypper install -t pattern devel_basis
    ```
    ````

2. It is recommended that the Linux platform used to run SoftConsole has all available updates installed.

    ```{note}
    It may be possible to install and run SoftConsole on other Linux distributions or versions once the required packages are installed. However, some earlier distributions (for example, CentOS/RHEL 5.x and 6.x) may not work and are not recommended or supported.
