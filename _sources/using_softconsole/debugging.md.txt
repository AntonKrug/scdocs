## Debug launch configurations

To debug a program a debug launch configuration must be created. Most of the default settings for a debug launch
configuration can be left as they are but a few needs to be manually configured. Use the example projects and
debug launch configurations as a guide to creating new debug launch configurations.

 1. Select the project in the Project Explorer and from the:

    {{ macros.breadcrumb_indent('"SoftConsole Menu toolbar" -> "Run" -> "Debug Configurations"','    ') }}

 2. In the Debug Configurations dialog select GDB OpenOCD Debugging and click on the New launch configuration button which will create a new debug launch configuration for the previously selected project.

 3. For PolarFire SoC Renode emulation please refer to the README provided with the PolarFire SoC/PSE example project(s) in the example workspace.

 4. On the Main tab ensure that the `C/C++ Application` field contains the correct executable name.
